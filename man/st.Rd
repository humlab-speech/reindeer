\title{Convert Herz to Semitones}
\usage{
st(x, ref = 16.3516)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of frequency values (in Hz)}

\item{ref}{The reference frequency. By default 16.35160 Hz (C$_0$) which is
the base frequency setting of a Phonogram.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of semitone scaled frequency values.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of frequencies (in Hz) and convert them to
semitones. By default, the frequency of the note C$_0$ is used as the
reference for the conversion, so that the output is compatible with the
defined base of a Phonogram

}
\details{
For Praat-compatible output please use one of 1, 100, 200, or 440 Hz as the
reference frequency.

\examples{
h <- seq(100,5000,100)
# Praat has 100 Hz as one of the reference frequency options for semitone calculations
s100 <- st(h,ref=100)
# Semitone distance from C_0
sC0 <- st(h)
#The differ between semitones relative to C0 and a 100 Hz frequency
st(h,ref=100) - st(h)
# phonogram (C0-C4) range in Semitones
