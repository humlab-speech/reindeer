\usage{
extract_samples(
  emuDBhandle,

  output.directory,

}
\arguments{
\item{emuDBhandle}{The database handle.}

\item{seglist}{A segment list (resulting from a call of \link{query}) which should
be used as a cut list.}

\item{output.directory}{The directory where all extracted parts of the
signal, and sub-folders if required, will be placed.}

\item{include.labels}{Boolean; Include the label of a segment in the output
file name?}

\item{include.metadata.fields}{Names of metadata fields whos values should be
included in the file name. If a boolean (TRUE) all metadata fields will be
encoded in the name of the output file.}

\item{create.session.subdir}{Boolean; Should bundles belonging to different
sessions be kept separate?}

\item{create.bundle.subdir}{Boolean; Should signal files belonging to
different bundles be kept separate?}

\item{encode.name}{boolean; Should the bundle name be obfuscated in the
output using md5 hashing?}

\item{field.separator}{The field separator string to use when constructing
the output file name.}
}
\description{
This function enables the user to extract parts of speech recordings based on
a segment list (resulting from a call of \link{query}). The extracted parts will
be named by the segment label, the first sample, last sample extracted, as
well as the sample rate of the original media file. The user can also append
metadata fields to the file file name following the segment label. The
extracted signal file will be placed in sub-folders according session and /
or bundle if the user specifies it. If
\verb{create.session.subdir=FALSE,create.bundle.subdir=FALSE}, all extracted
signal portions will be placed together in the output directory.
}
\details{
Optionally, the user may obfuscate the bundle name by MD5 hashing. This
process makes the origin of the recording not possible to deduce from the
name.
