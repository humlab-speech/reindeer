abstract = {{ Purpose Data on vowel formants have been derived primarily from static measures representing an assumed steady state. This review summarizes data on formant frequencies and bandwidths for American English and also addresses (a) sources of variability (focusing on speech sample and time sampling point), and (b) methods of data reduction such as vowel area and dispersion. Method Searches were conducted with CINAHL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and other online sources including legacy articles and references. The primary search items were vowels, vowel space area, vowel dispersion, formants, formant frequency, and formant bandwidth. Results Data on formant frequencies and bandwidths are available for both sexes over the lifespan, but considerable variability in results across studies affects even features of the basic vowel quadrilateral. Origins of variability likely include differences in speech sample and time sampling point. The data reveal the emergence of sex differences by 4 years of age, maturational reductions in formant bandwidth, and decreased formant frequencies with advancing age in some persons. It appears that a combination of methods of data reduction provide for optimal data interpretation. Conclusion The lifespan database on vowel formants shows considerable variability within}},

abstract = {{BackgroundCurrent pediatric voice assessment guidelines include instrumental measurements of fundamental frequency (F0) and the perturbation indices jitter and shimmer. In children below 10 years, gender, age, height and weight effects on these parameters have been inconsistently characterized. Recent research in healthy children showed, that differences in habitual speaking voice intensity (voice SPL) under the usual assessment procedure significantly affect jitter and shimmer. These effects were reduced in phonations with controlled voice SPL >80dBA. Reliable measurement methods and description of physiologic influencing factors are essential to identify pathologic voices.ObjectiveThis cross-sectional single cohort study investigates in children between 5;0 and 9;11 years how gender, age, height and weight affect voice F0, jitter and shimmer in phonations at individually “medium” voice intensity (modeling the usual clinical practice) and with controlled voice SPL >80dBA.Subjects and methods68 vocally healthy children (39 f/29 m) aged 5;0–9;11 years provided 3 prolonged phonations of/a/at individually “medium” and controlled voice intensity at “>80dBA” (visual feedback, 10cm distance). F0 (Hz), jitter (\%), shimmer (\%) and voice SPL (dBA) were determined with PRAAT. Gender, age, height and weight effects without and with controlled voice SPL were assessed by descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance and Linear Mixed Models.ResultsF0 (Hz), jitter (\%), shimmer (\%) and voice SPL (dBA) were significantly different in medium voice compared to >80dBA (p<0.01). In medium phonations girls had a higher F0 than boys (girls: 276.7(50.7), boys: 261.5(33.7)), but with >80dBA this difference was only minimal (girls: 328.9(52.2), boys 327.9(51.2)). Mean jitter (0.27(0.10)) and shimmer (4.34(1.68)) were smaller and showed less spread (jitter: 0.5(0.26); shimmer: 9.47(3.47)) with >80dBA. Gender, age, height and weight had no significant effects on F0, jitter, shimmer and voice SPL in both phonation types (p-range=0.42–0.99).ConclusionsNeither without nor with controlled voice SPL there were systematic gender, age, height or weight effects on voice F0, jitter and shimmer. Gender related F0 discrepancies were equalized in phonations with >80dBA. In children below 10 years gender related acoustic voice differences may be mainly linked to behavior, which should be considered in future works regarding physiologic voice development.}},

abstract = {{ Women's voice pitch (the perceptual correlate of fundamental frequency, F0) varies across the menstrual cycle and lowers after menopause, and may represent a putative signal of women's fertility and reproductive age. Yet, despite dramatic changes in women's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy, previous between-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in F0 due to pregnancy. Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels. Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women's voices.}},

abstract = {{This paper examines four acoustic correlates of vowel identity in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European Portuguese (EP): first formant (F1), second formant (F2), duration, and fundamental frequency (F0). Both varieties of Portuguese display some cross-linguistically common phenomena: vowel-intrinsic duration, vowel-intrinsic pitch, gender-dependent size of the vowel space, gender-dependent duration, and a skewed symmetry in F1 between front and back vowels. Also, the average difference between the vocal tract sizes associated with /i/ and /u/, as measured from formant analyses, is comparable to the average difference between male and female vocal tract sizes. A language-specific phenomenon is that in both varieties of Portuguese the vowel-intrinsic duration effect is larger than in many other languages. Differences between BP and EP are found in duration (BP has longer stressed vowels than EP), in F1 (the lower-mid front vowel approaches its higher-mid counterpart more closely in EP than in BP), and in the size of the intrinsic pitch effect (larger for BP than for EP).}},
